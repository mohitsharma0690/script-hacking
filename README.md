script-hacking
==============

Assorted collection of random scripts I use

#### Selectively Remove Google News
Add a `Hide news` link corresponding to each google news link. Click on the link
to actually hide that news. In case you reload the page the news item would appear 
again. To do the latter you need to persist that information somewhere and for now 
this is just a greasemonkey script.

#### Remove FB Feed
Removes feed from the fb page.
